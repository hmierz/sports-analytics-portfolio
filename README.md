This repository showcases applied analytics projects in sports, with a focus on quantitative methods, hypothesis testing, and reproducible workflows.

## Project 1 — Economic impact of fighting in the NHL

- **Question:** What is the economic impact of allowing fighting in the NHL on fan attendance and TV viewership?
- **Approach:** Quantitative design; hypotheses; literature review; historical trend analysis.
- **Independent variables:** Frequency of fights, overall aggression.
- **Dependent variables:** Fan attendance, TV viewership.
- **Key takeaway:** Evidence suggests fighting does not significantly increase regular season attendance, and fights per game have declined over time while fan interest persists for other factors (team performance, market size, broadcast experience).

### Methods used
- Hypothesis formulation and testing
- Variable selection (predictor/response)
- Trend analysis and literature synthesis
- Interpretation in an economics-of-sports context

### Next steps
- Extend framework to basketball: analyze whether aggression/pace/shot selection correlate with fan engagement (attendance, ratings), and team outcomes (win probability, efficiency).
